# Ashley-s-Webgame

Thanks for playing Ashley's Webgame! This has been very nostalgic of my childhood and I have always loved playing both board and computer games.  I love the creative process and being able to make something from nothing...which is precisely what drew me to web development in the first place.  Anyway, good luck and have fun!!!!
